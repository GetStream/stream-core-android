/**
 * Manages the SDKâ€™s authentication token lifecycle.
 *
 * A `StreamTokenManager` exposes the current token as a hot [kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow] and
 * provides operations to supply a [StreamTokenProvider], set a token directly, and invalidate the
 * current token. Implementations are expected to cache the latest valid token and retrieve a new
 * one via the provider on demand.
 *
 * ### Semantics
 * - [token] emits the most recently known token, or `null` if no token is available.
 * - Calling [setProvider] registers the source from which new tokens will be obtained.
 * - Calling [setToken] sets the token immediately (useful when you already have one).
 * - Calling [invalidate] clears the current token; the next access may trigger a refresh if a
 *   provider has been set.
 *
 * ### Threading
 * Implementations should be safe to use from any thread. The [token] flow is hot and never
 * completes.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val tokenManager = StreamTokenManager()
 * tokenManager.setProvider(MyTokenProvider())
 * tokenManager.token.value // null
 * ```
