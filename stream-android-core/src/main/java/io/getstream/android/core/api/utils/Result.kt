/**
 * Returns the result of applying the given [transform] function to the value of this [Result] if it
 * is [Result.isSuccess], or propagates the failure if it is [Result.isFailure].
 *
 * This is the "monadic bind" operation for [Result] â€” it allows chaining of operations where each
 * step returns a [Result], without nesting (avoids `Result<Result<R>>`).
 *
 * @param T The type of the success value in the receiver [Result].
 * @param R The type of the success value in the returned [Result].
 * @param transform A function to transform the success value into another [Result].
 * @return The [Result] returned by [transform] if this [Result] is successful, or the original
 *   failure if this [Result] is a failure.
 * @throws Throwable if [transform] throws, including [CancellationException].
