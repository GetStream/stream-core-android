/**
 * Returns the result of applying the given [transform] function to the value of this [Result] if it
 * is [Result.isSuccess], or propagates the failure if it is [Result.isFailure].
 *
 * This is the "monadic bind" operation for [Result] â€” it allows chaining of operations where each
 * step returns a [Result], without nesting (avoids `Result<Result<R>>`).
 *
 * Unlike [flatMapCatching], this function does **not** catch exceptions thrown by [transform]:
 * - If [transform] throws any exception, including [CancellationException], it is rethrown.
 *
 * @param T The type of the success value in the receiver [Result].
 * @param R The type of the success value in the returned [Result].
 * @param transform A function to transform the success value into another [Result].
 * @return The [Result] returned by [transform] if this [Result] is successful, or the original
 *   failure if this [Result] is a failure.
 * @throws Throwable if [transform] throws, including [CancellationException].

/**

 *
 * This is similar to [flatMap], but **catches** any exception thrown by [transform] and wraps it in
 * a failed [Result], **except** for [CancellationException], which is always rethrown to preserve
 * coroutine cancellation.
 *
 * Behaves like [mapCatching], but for functions that return [Result] directly.
 *
 * @param T The type of the success value in the receiver [Result].

 * @param transform A function to transform the success value into another [Result]. If this

 *     - A [CancellationException]: it is rethrown.
 *
 * @return The [Result] returned by [transform] if this [Result] is successful and [transform]
 *   completes normally, or a failed [Result] if [transform] throws a non-cancellation exception, or
 *   the original failure if this [Result] is a failure.
 * @throws CancellationException if either this [Result] is a failure with a [CancellationException]
