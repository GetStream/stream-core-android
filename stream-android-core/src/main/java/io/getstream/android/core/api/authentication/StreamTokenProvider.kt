/**
 * Supplies authentication tokens (JWTs) for a given user.
 *
 * Implementations usually call **your backend** to mint or fetch a signed, short-lived JWT for the
 * provided user ID. Never embed server secrets or mint tokens on-device.
 *
 * ### Contract
 * - Must return a valid, signed JWT for the requested [userId].
 * - May be invoked multiple times (e.g., initial connect, refresh); implement caching if
 *   appropriate.
 * - This is a `suspend` function; perform network/IO work without blocking and respect
 *   cancellation.
 * - Signal failures by throwing an exception (donâ€™t return empty/placeholder tokens).
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * class MyTokenProvider(
 *     private val authApi: AuthApi
 * ) : StreamTokenProvider {
 *     override suspend fun loadToken(userId: String): StreamToken {
 *         // Network call to your service; may throw on failure
 *         val response = authApi.issueToken(userId)
 *         val streamToken = StreamToken.from(response.token)
 *         return streamToken
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Security
 * - Token creation/rotation must happen on your server.
 * - Prefer short expirations and refresh on demand.
